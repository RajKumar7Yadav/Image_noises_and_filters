Bluring techniques are applied to reduce image noise. Bluring can be done using convolutional kernek i.e taking a 3X3 matrix , passing it over the images and doing operations and calculating the value for image matrix.

Kernel convolution is the base of mean blur , gaussian blur and edge detection. In kernel convolution we take a small grid of kernel and passing it over the whole image we transform the image.
